# Adenovirus-Based-COVID-19-Vaccines
### Simulation of Immunological Response Post-Vaccination

The ODE-based model introduced in this work is based on the biological signalling pathway of the immune response to vaccination. The model includes both cellular and
humoral immune system components, including vaccine particles, T helper cells, interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³), interleukin 6 (IL6), plasma B-cells, antibodies, and cytotoxic 
T-cells. Model parameters were fit to clinical trial data for the COVID-19 ChAdOx1-S (AZD1222) vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. By executing
the Julia language scripts named "Vaccine.ipynb" and "Vaccine,test parameter fitting,Final fitted.ipynb", simulations can be observed post-primary and booster doses of the vaccine, 
alongside the outcomes of the parameter fitting process.
